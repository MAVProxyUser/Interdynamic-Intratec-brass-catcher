# Interdynamic KG99 + Intratec Tec9, DC9, & AB10 Brass Catcher
Brass catcher for Intradynamic, Intratec TEC9, including "mini" variants. 

The large version will *hold* approximately 150 casings. It is not recommended to have any more than 100 total however. 
Likewise the small version will *hold* approximately 100 casings, but it is not recommended to have any more than 75 rounds total. 

Ignoring the max round counts can induce jamming by causing the casings to reflect back into the ejection port. Please report jamming problems via the [issues](https://github.com/MAVProxyUser/Interdynamic-Intratec-brass-catcher/issues) page, note the extractor type (OEM, or aftermarket replacement), and the round count at which point the jam occured. Standard Tec9 jamming need not apply, only *stove pipe* style issues that are caused by improper deflection into the catcher are applicable.

## Project Design
This was modeled after EL MFG Part No 124, and slightly modified for use with Czech Nine, as well as the "mini" models that EL MFG did not support.

## Use

Snap it right on... or in the case of the mini variants, first ensure that you've seated the catcher under the rear rail gap in order to hold it snugly in place.
